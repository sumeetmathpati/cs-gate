- Recursion is the basis for the divide and conquer algorithms.
- Here in this topic we are going to see
    - **Recursion**
    - **Recurrence relation**
    - **Recurrence relation solving**


# Recursion

- The function calling itself to solve a perticular topic is called recursion.
- We use recursion to solve big problems by dividing it and solving smaller versions of the problem.
- Every recursive program have termination condition.
- Every recursive program have equivalent non-recursive (iterative) program.
- Comparing equivalent recursive program; the recursive program will take more memory.
