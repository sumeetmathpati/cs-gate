- The functions in increasing order are given below

## Decreasing Functions

- We have decreasing functions like $\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n^2}, \frac{1}{n^3}...$
- These are called decreasing functions because as the value of $n$ increases the value of the whole function decreases.
- But the time for algorithm execution can't decrease (when input size increases) and hence while measuring time complexity we don't get these functions.

## Constant Functions

## Logarithmic Functions

## $\sqrt{n}$

## Linear Functions

## Quadratic Fcuntions

## Cubit

## Polynomial

- $n^c$, where *c* is a constant > 0.
    - Example $n^{0.1}, n^{0.5}, n^1, n^{100}$

## Exponential

- $c^n$, where *c* is a constant > 1.
    - Example $2^n, 3^n, 5.6^n$

## $n^n$
