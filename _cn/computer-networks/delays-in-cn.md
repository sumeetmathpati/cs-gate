## Transmission Delay

- **Time required to put complete data on the line.**
- It's depend upon:
    - The size of data. Bigger the data, longer the time.
    - The capacity / bandwidth of the medium. Bigger the bandwidth, smalled the time.


<p class="w3-center w3-padding info">$Transmission \ Delay = \frac{Length \ Of \ Data}{Bandwidth \ Of \ Medium}$</p>

***

## Propagation Delay

- **Time required for one bit to propogate/travel to the reciever from sender.**
- It's depend upon:
    - Lenght/distance to travel.
    - Propogation speec / velocity.

<p class="w3-center w3-padding info">$Propogation \ Delay = \frac{Distance}{Transmission \ Speed}$</p>
