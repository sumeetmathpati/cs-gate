- The working of networking in computers is divided into several different layers.
- Each layer performs functions and produce some output which is useful to the layer above / below it.
    - The layer supposed to do it's work idependantly so that other layer don't have to worry about it.
- In general we have two differnt models of thee layers.
    - **OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)**
    - **TCP/IP model**
- OSI model is theoratical model which describes the functions of networks.
- The TCP/IP is the name of the model which is practical implementation and used in real worls.
    - Unlike OSI model , it's not conceptual, it's used in real world.
    - The name TCP/TP is because they are the two of the protocols used in the layer in model.
