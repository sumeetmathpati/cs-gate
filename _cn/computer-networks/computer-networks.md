# Data Communication

- To start communication we use digital or analog devices like (computer, mobile, camera) and we call them source.
- But nowadays we use digital devices (like computers) for communication.
- **Transmitter:**
    - We can't send data in digital form, first we have to convert it into analog signal.
    - To convert digital data into analog, we use devices like *modem*.
    - These analog signals can be electical or light/optical signals (in case of optical fibre channel) or radio signals.
- **Transmision Medium:**
    - We send the data through wires like twisted pair, coaxial cable, optical fibre, wireless etc.
    - Reciever (which is again can be a computer, a mobile, a camera) again converts the signal beack into the digital signal (again using specific modem)

# Signals 

- Signals can be 
    - **Analog:**
        - It's an electrical, optical or radio  representation of the data, which we can send over transmission media.
        - It's a continuous waves.
        - As we can see in the image below, the analog signal have **infinite** values in the any part of the signal.
    - **Digital:**
        - Digital signals are dicrete.
        - Unlike analog they have limited number of defines values.
            - Usually we have 0's or 1's.
        - As we can see in the picture below, the digital signal have limited values for limited part of a signal.
