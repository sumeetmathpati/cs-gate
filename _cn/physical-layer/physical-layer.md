- The physical layer does the functions required to transmit a bit stream over a physical medium. 
- It works as lowest level of networks like physical hardware and elecronic specifications the primary connections such as **cable**, **connectors** and **signalling** options that physically link two nodes on a network. 
- The first layer receives a data unit from the second layer (on sender's side); put it into a format capable of being carried by a communications link.

## Functionalities of Physical Layer

### Cables and connectors
    
- Here we choose our transmission media to transfer the data.
- We select cables like twisted pair or ciaxial, connectors like RJ45 or RJ11.

### Physical topologies

- Phycial layer also decides the topologies.
- Topologies is nothing but the pattern in which digital devices connected in a network.
- Example,Start topology, Mesh Topology, Ring Topoligy, etc.

### Transmission mode

- Transmission of data in transmission medium can be of various types, and we can choose them according to our needs.
- Tramission modes are
    - **Simplex**
        - In simplex communication we can send the data in single direction only.
        - Example, Radio station. Radio station only sends the signal; never recieves.
    - **Half Duplex**
        - In half duplex, we can send data in both direction but in only one direction at a time.
        - Example, Walkie-Talkie.
    - **Full Duplex**
        - In full duplex, we can send data in both direction simultaneously.
        - Example, Mobile or telephone.

### Multiplexing

- Multiplexing is the technique we use to transfer multiple analog and digital signal over the shared cable.
- There are various multiplexing techniques to choose from, we do that also in plysical layer.

## Encoding

- Process of converting/**encoding** analog signals to digital or vice versa; or even digital to digital or analog to analog is called **encoding**.
- Here we choose which coding to use for data transfer.
