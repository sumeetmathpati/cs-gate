- When there are multiple computer or networking devices present in the netowork, the capacity of the link is shared among those devices.
- As the channel is shared among devices, we have to make sure that no two devices should transfer data at the same time otherwise collision of the data can happer.
- So the **access control protocol is used to give access of the channel to single device to share data.**
- Only broadcast linkes (links where multiple divices are connected) require access control protocol and P2P don't require access control protocol.
- The sharing of channel can happern in two ways    
    - **Time division multiplexng (TDM)**
    - **Frequency division multiplexing (FDM)**
