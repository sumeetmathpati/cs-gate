# Types of Programming Languags

## Imperative languages

- These are **command based and procedural languages.**
- Desingned on **Vonn Neuman architecture.**
- They support concept of variable (variable is a reference to the location in memory).
- Support loops.
- May support recursion.

### Types

- **Data oriented languages**
	- Provide features for data abstraction
		- Example, struct.
	- Examples, Simula, C
- **Object oriented languages**
	- They support features of OOPS.
	- Smalltalk, C++, Java
- **Scripting languages**
	- They don't have strict syntax.
	- Support dynamic declarations and dynamic type checking.
	- Javascript, Python

***

## Declarative languages

- These are **non procedural languages.**
- Design is based on **lambda calculus.**
- There is **no concept of variables.**
- **Don't have loops.**
- Only support recursion.

### Types
- **Functional programming**
	- Based on lambda calculus.
	- They directly support mathematical functions.
	- Examples, Haskell, Lisp
- **Logical programming**
	- Based on propositional calculus, which is derived from lambda calculus.
	- The work is based on true or flase statement.
	- They are used for theorem proving.
	- Their progrmas will have 3 elements
		- Fact
			- Information or data.
		- Rule
			- Relationship between the facts.
		- Query
			- It's the request for retrieving the informstion.
	- Example, Prolog

## Data flow languages

- Used by designers to **define flow of data** between components of the system.
- Used in development of destributed applications.
- Examples VAL, XML

***

## Visual programming languages

- They support RAD (Rapid application development) parasigm.
- They support program fraindly IDE for **visually developing applications.**
- Examples, .NET, JAVA.
