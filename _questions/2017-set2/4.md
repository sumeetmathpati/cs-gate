### Let *L1* , *L2* be any two context-free languages and *R* be any regular language. Then which of the following is/are CORRECT?

- I. $L_1 \cup L_2$ is context-free
- II. $\overline{L_1}$
- II. $L_1 - R$
- IV. $L_1 \cap L_2$

<ul class="w3-ul w3-border">
  <li>A) I, II and IV only</li>
  <li>B) I and III only</li>
  <li>C) II and IV only</li>
  <li>D) I only</li>
</ul>

### Ansnwer: **B**

### Explaination:

- I is TRUE as CFGs are closed under union.
- II is FALSE as CFGs are not enclosed under complementation.
- III is TRUE as L1−R can be written as L1 ∩ R̄. Regular language are closed under complementation and
intersection of CFG and Regular is CFG.
- IV is FALSE as CFGs are not enclosed under intersection.
