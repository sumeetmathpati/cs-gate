- The parser is called recursive descent parser; because for every variable; we write recursive functions.
- To implement any algorithm we have two methods, **iterative** and **recursive.**
- But recursive approach require more stack, therefore a non-recursive approach is more preferred.
- It's very simple compared to non-recursive descent (LL1).
- It's **less powerful than LL1.**
- Here to design RD parser; we construct precedure/function for every non-terminal.
