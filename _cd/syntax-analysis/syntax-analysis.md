- It's also called **parsing.**
- It's a second phase in compilation.
- This phase takes tokens as input from lexical analysis phase.
- As name suggests, this phase **checks if syntax of input is correct or not**.
    - It's done by **parser or syntax analyzer** by generating **parse tree**.
- To design syntax analyzer, we use **unambigious Context Free Grammar** and **pushown automata**.
    - Context free grammar is a way to tell the compiler, what is the correct synta accorrding to us or our language we've created.
    - Checking whether the given string is member of the given CFG is called parsing, if it does belong to the language generated by our grammar, then we can say the passed HLL don't have any syntax errors.

# Types of Parsers

![Types of parsers]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cd/types-of-parsers.jpg)

## Top-Down Parser

- Left recirsive grammars are not suitable for top-down parsers.

### Backtracking
### No-Backtracking

#### Recursive Descent Parser
#### Non-Recursive Descent Parser / LL(1) [IMP for GATE]

## Bottom-Up Parser

- **Top-down parsers are more powerful than the top down parser.**
    - Hence langauge generated by bottom up parser are more than the top down parser.
- Left recirsive grammars are suitable for top-down parsers.

### Operator Precedence Parser
### Shift Reduce Parser / LR [IMP for GATE]

#### LR(0)
#### SLR(1)
#### LALR(1)
#### CLR(1)

Recursive grammars means grammars containing recursion.
