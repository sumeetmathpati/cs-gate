- OS is an **interface between user and computer hardware.**    
- OS works as **resource allocator.**
    - **Resource can be hardware or software.**
- OS makes accessing these resource easy for programmers.
- We use different system calls provided by OS as an interface to interact with resources.
    - Example, We use `printf()` function in C, which calls `write()` function call provided by OS.
