## Degree of Multiprogramming

- It's a **number of processes present in main memory at any point of time.**

***

## Throughput

- **Number of processes executing per unit of time.**

***

## Context switching

- Switching the context of one process and loading another process is called context switching.
- If process has more context attributes, context switching time will be more.
- Context switching is considered as overhead for system
- Every time the process changes the state, contxt of the process is changed.
- In special case, even if there is only one process is there in the system, still the context is switched,
	- Example, in round robon scheduling algorithm.
