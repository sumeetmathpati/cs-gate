- Tokens are smallest individual units of program.
- In C programming, we have 6 types of tokens
    - **Constants**
        - Examples, 100, 3.14 etc.
    - **Strings**
        - Example, "Hello", "GATE" etc.
    - **Special Symbols**
        - Example [], {}, < > etc
    - **Indentifiers**
        - These are named given to the functions and variables.
        - Example, main, printf.
    - **Keywords**
        - These are reserved keywords by C language.
        - There are 32 keywords.
        - Example, int, break etc.
    - **Operators**
        - Example +, *, /, = etc.

# Keywords:

- There are 32 keywords reserved in C which has some fixed meaning to the compiler. 
- They are building blocks of a C program.
- The 32 keywords are as follows.



|auto         |double      |int        |struct|
|break        |else        |long       |switch|
|case         |enum        |register   |typedef|
|char         |extern      |return     |union|
|const        |float       |short      |unsigned|
|continue     |for         |signed     |void|
|default      |goto        |sizeof     |volatile|
|do           |if          |static     |while|
