- Here we can't find the solution to the problem.
    - We can't even say Yes to the valid srings (like REL).
    - There problems are undecidable.

# Example

- If we want to to check if the grammar is unambiguous; we can follow following steps:
    1. Create a string representing grammar.
    2. Pass that string through the TM.
    3. TM will try to find the ambiguity in the grammar.
        - This will take infinite time, as there are infinite string generated by the grammar.
- Hence **this problem is undecidable.**
