- RE languages of type-0 languages are generated by type-0 grammars.
- An RE language can be accepted by TM, i.e. TM machine will enter into final state for string of REL and TM may or may not enter into final state for string which are not in REL.
- It means TM can loop forever for string which are not part of the REL.
- REL is also called as turing recognizable language.
- A halting TM is similar to the algorithm (which also never goes into infinite loop).
- RELs **also known as partially decidable languages.**
    - We call it partial, because we can answer some questions.
    - For example, we can say if the DFA generae empty language or not.
    - But we can't say if the grammar is unambiguous or not.
- RELs **also known as Turing recognizable languages.**
- **Recursive languges are subclass of recursive enumerable languages.**

When we say Turing machine; we are talking about may or may not halting TM.

# Example

- Let's say, we want to find if the grammar is ambiguous.
- To do so; we can follow the following steps.
    1. Create a string representing the grammar.
    2. Pass that string in TM.
    3. TM will detect (abviously we can to implement the logic) if the grammar have multiple parse trees for a same string.
        - If yes; then TM will say true.
        - If no; TM will go into infinite loop, because there are infinite strings to check for ambiguity.
