# Union

- Regualr languages are **closed under union** operation. 
- Union of two regular languages is always a regular language.
- **Example,**
    - **L1 = a(a+b)<sup>*</sup>** and **L2 = b(a+b)<sup>*</sup>**
        - L1 ∪ L2 = a(a+b)<sup>\*</sup> + b(a+b) = (a+b)(a+b)<sup>\*</sup> = (a+b)<sup>*</sup> is a regular languagage.

## Infinite Union

- Regualr languages are **NOT CLOSED under infinite union** operation.
- Infinite union of two regular languages may or may not be regular.
- **Examples,**
    - **L1 = a(a+b)<sup>*</sup>** and **L2 = b(a+b)<sup>*</sup>**
        - **(a+b)<sup>\*</sup> ∪ L1 ∪ L2**

# Intersection

- Regualr languages are **closed under intersection** operation.



## Inifite Intersection

- Regualr languages are **NOT CLOSED under infinite intersection** operation

# Concatenation

- Regualt languages are **closed** under concatenation operation.

# Complement

- Complement of regular language is **always regular.**
