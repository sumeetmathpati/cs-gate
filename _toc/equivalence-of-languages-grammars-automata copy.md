# Finite State Automata

- To design a **lexical analyzer** for compiler.
- Pattern recognition using **regular expressions** in text editors.
- To design combinational and sequential machines using **Mealy and Morre** machines.
- Implement **spell checkers.**

# Push Down Automata

- To design **parser** for a compiler.
- To implement stack applications, like eveluating arithmetic expressions.

# Linear Bound Automata

- To construct **symantic parse tree** for compiler.

# Turing Machine

- Solve recursively enumerable problems
- In the fields of artificial intelligence, neural networks, robotics
