- **Computation is the step by step solution to a problem.**
- Example,
	- Computing product of numbers.
	- Finding word in dictionary.
- Automata theory (also known as Theory Of Computation) is a theoretical branch of Computer Science and Mathematics, which mainly deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as automata.
- It's mainly about what kind of things can you computer mechanically how fast that will be and how much space does it consumes.
- So, **in TOC we are going to do:**
	- Take a input,
	- Create a machine which has some rules and then we pass that string to that machine.
	- Based on those rules machine will either accept or rejects the string.

## Atomaton

- To solve problems or to perform computations, we have different computing devices, these devices are called atomata (plural).
- Examples,
	- Calculator, Mobile, Computer, Pen and Paper
- In TOC **we study computation devices based on the resources that they use.**
- We study the power and limitations of these devices, learn which problems do they solve.
