- TOC delas with automata theory and formal languages.
- **Computation is the step by step solution to a problem.**
- **Examples,**
	- Computing product of numbers.
	- Finding word in dictionary.
- In TOC, we deal with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as **automata.**
- It's mainly about **what kind of things can you compute mechanically** how fast that will be and how much space does it consumes.
- So, **in TOC we are going to do:**
	- Take a input,
	- Create a machine which has some rules and then we pass that input string to that machine.
	- Based on those rules machine will either accept or rejects the string.

## Atomaton

- To solve problems or to perform computations, we have different computing devices, these devices are called atomata (plural).
- Examples,
	- Calculator, Mobile, Computer, Pen and Paper
- In TOC **we study computation devices based on the resources that they use.**
- We study the power and limitations of these machines, learn which problems do they solve.
