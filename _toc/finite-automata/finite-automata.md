- Finite automata is a mathematical model which contains finite number of sets and transitions.

# Classification of Finite Automata

- **With output**
	- DFA
	- NFA
	- Îµ-NFA
- **With output**
	- Mealy machine
	- Moore machine

- If there is no common difference in the length of a strings accepted by DFA and the languge is infinite then FA can't accept the language.
