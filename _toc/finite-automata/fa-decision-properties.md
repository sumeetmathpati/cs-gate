# Equivalence Property

- It's **decidable** if two FA's are equal or not.

## Procedure

### Method 1

- Construct a minimal DFA for both the FAs.
- If the minimal DFAs are same, then two FAs are also same.

### Method 2

# Finiteness Property

- It's decidable it the FA accepts the finite language of not.
