- **Electrical and Electronics:**
    - **Electrical engineering** is a professional engineering desciplin that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism and **heavy voltage** devices like transformers, motors etc.
    - We can say that **electronics** is brach of electrical which deal with **low voltages,** such as semiconductors like transistors, diodes ICs to design electronic circuits, VLSI devices and systems.
- In digital machines (like computers) we represent discrete information (such as digits, letter) with the help of **electrical signals** (such as voltage and current).
- Electric signals with two discrete values **0 vtg and high vtg** are easy to recognize and human logic is also binary (like true or false, see propositional logic for more information), **digital systems use binary values.**
