- In digital machines (like computers) we represent discrete information (such as digits, letter) with the help of **electrical signals** (such as voltage and current).
- Electric signals with two discrete values **0 vtg and high vtg** are easy to recognize and human logic is also binary (like true or false, see propositional logic for more information), **digital systems use binary values.**
