- A counter is a sequential circuit that goes through predetermined sequence of binary states  upon the application of input pulses.
- The gates in the counter are connected in such a way as to produce the prescribed sequence of states.
- A counter that follows the binary number sequence is called binary counter.
    - An n-binary counter consists of n flip flops and can counter from o to 2^n - 1..
- Counter are available in two categories:
    - **Syncronous counters**
    - **Ansyncronous counter or ripple counters**
