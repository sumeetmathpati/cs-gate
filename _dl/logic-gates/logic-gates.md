- In digital electronics is a physical device used to **implement boolean function**.
- It **takes one or more input and produce single output signal.**
- These logic gates are implemeted using semiconductor devices; but we shall use only symbols in digital electronics.
- These are basic building blocks to construct logic circuits.
