            The microinstructions stored in the control memory of a processor 
            have a width of 26 bits. Each microinstruction is divided into 
            three fields: a micro-operation field of 13 bits, a next address 
            field (X), and a MUX select field (Y). There are 8 status bits 
            in the input of the MUX.

            A hard disk with a transfer rate of 10 Mbytes/second is constantly 
            transferring data to memory using DMA. The processor runs at 600 MHz, 
            and takes 300 and 900 clock cycles to initiate and complete DMA 
            transfer respectively. If the size of the transfer is 20 Kbytes, 
            what is the percentage of processor time consumed for the transfer 
            operation?

            Let us assume that CPU contains two processes when one process is being 
            executed on the CPU the other one is swapped out arid all the data is saved on 
            the disk, and when the other one in progress then all the data of first 
            process saved  on  the disk, Thus the swap space is basically Used for saving the process data.

            A device with data transfer rate 10 KB/sec is connected to a CPU. 
            Data is transferred byte-wise. Let the interrupt overhead be 4 μsec. 
            The byte transfer time between the device interface register and CPU 
            or memory is negligible. What is the minimum performance gain of 
            operating the device under interrupt mode over operating it under 
            program-controlled mode?
