            Consider the following nested representation of binary trees: (X Y Z)
            indicates Y and Z are the left and right subtrees, respectively, of 
            node X. Note that Y and Z may be NULL, or further nested. Which of 
            the following represents a valid binary tree?

            Suppose that we have numbers between 1 and 100 in a binary search 
            tree and want to search for the number 55. Which of the following

            Option C cannot be the sequence of BST. Because after 47 we went for 68 
            (which is greater than 47), that means all the values coming in 
            the set must be greater than 47. But then we have 43 in set.
