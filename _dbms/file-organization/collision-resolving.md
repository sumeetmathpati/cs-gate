- When the hash value key maps to an already occupied bucket of the hash table, it's called as a collision.
- To resolve collisions we use following techniques:
    - **Open Addressing (closed hashing):**
        - **Linear probing**
        - **Quadratic probing**
        - **Double hashing**
    - **Chaining (open hashing):**
