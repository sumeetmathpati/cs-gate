- Relational algebra and relational calculus are two formal query languages accisiated with **relational model.**
- Like any other mathematical system, relational algebra define the number of operators and uses relations (tables) as oprands.
- Every operator takes **one or two tables as input** and produces **single table as output.**
- As it's based on set theory, relational algebra does not allow duplicate rows in output table.
- The **output table doesn't have any name** associated with it.
- Relational algebra is **procedural query language,** hence we describe step by step procedure to get result.
    - Relational calculus is non-procedural query language.
- **SQL is based on relational algebra.**
    - SQL and relational algebra are equal in power.
