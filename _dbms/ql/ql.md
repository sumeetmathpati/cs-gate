- First we've designed ER diagrams, then based on ER diagrams we've designed our relational model. Then we've normalized and indexed it to increase efficiency and decrease the redundancy.
- Now our next task is to **insert**, **retrieve** and **modify** the data in the database.
- We use query languages for that.

# Types of Query Languages

## Procedural

- To get the intended results we have to give system a step by step procedure.
- We have to tell what data we want and how to get it.
- Example, **Relational algebra.**

## Non-procedural

- Here we just have to tell what data we want and NOT how to get that data.
- Example, **Relational calculus.**

***

- Relational algebra and relational calculus are mathematical models which gives us the techniques/methods which are used to query the relational model.
- RA and Rc are just a models and not used direct practically in real world.
- SQL is a practical implementation of the RA which is used in real world RDBMS.
