Following are the laws follwed by sets for different operations.

# Commutative laws

- A ∪ B = B ∪ B
- A ∩ B = B ∩ A
- A ∆ B = B ∆ B

# Associative law

- (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)
- (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C)
- (A ∆ B) ∆ C = A ∆ (B ∆ C)
- (A X B) X C = A X (B X C)

# Distributive law

- A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
- A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)

# De Morgan's law

- A ∪ B = A' ∩ B'
- A ∩ B = A' ∪ B'

# Identity law

- A ∪ A = A
- A ∩ A = A

# Idempotent law

- A ∪ (A ∩ B) = A
- A ∩ (A ∪ B) = A

# Misc

- A ∪ (B - A) = A ∪ B
- A - B = A ∩ B' = B' - A'
- A - (B ∪ C) = (A - B) ∩ (A - C)
- A ∪ (B - C) = (A ∪ B) - (C - A)
