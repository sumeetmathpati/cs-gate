- **It's a well defined, unordred collection of distinct object/elements of same type.**
    - **Well defined** means it's clearly defined if the element is in the set or not.
    - **Unordered** means the order of elements in a set dont matter, i.e. {1, 2, 3} and {2, 1, 3} both sets are same.
- Set are fundamental descrete structure, on which most of the descrete structures are built. So, set is used to group objects together.

# Set Representation

- Sets usually shows in following two forms:

## Roster

A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

## Set Builder Form 

A = {x \| x &isin; N, x < 5}
