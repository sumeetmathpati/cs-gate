- Tree is collection of nodes and edges.
- Trees are graphs without cycles.
- If there are n nodes, there will be (n - 1) edges.

## Terminology

- **Parent**
	- A node is a parent to its very next node or to a node which is connected to it with 1 edge.
- **Sublings**
	- Siblings are children of same parents.
- **Descendents**
	- Descendents are set of nodes which are children and children of children and so on to a node.
	- All nodes which can be reached from the node.
- **Ancestors**
	- For any node all the nodes in the path between it and the root node are ancestors.
- **Degree of node**
	- Degree of a node is number of direct children node is having.
- **Internal nodes / non terminal**
	- Nodes with degeree greater than zero are internal nodes (except root node).
- **External / leaf / terminal nodes**
	- Nodes with zero degree are leaf nodes.
- **Height / depth**
	- Height is number of edges required to get there.
- **Level**
    - Level starts from 0, i.e. root node is at level 0.
    - Level = height + 1.

## Tree traversal

- Three tyes of tree traversal are present:
	- **Preorder**
		- NLR
	- **Inorder**
		- LNR
	- **Postorder**
		- LRN
- The time complexity of all algorithms given above is O(n).
