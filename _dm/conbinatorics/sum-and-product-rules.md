# Rule of Product

- **The rule of product** is:
    - If 
        - a task $T$ is divided into tasks $T_1, T_2, ...T_n$,
        - The divided tasks $T1$ can be done in $p$ ways, $T2$ can be done in $q$ ways, $T3$ can be done in $r$ ways and so on,
        - $T1, T2, T3..$. are happening **simultaneously.**
    - Then,
        - The total number of ways to do the task $T$ is $p * q * r * ...$

# Rule of Sum

- **The rule of sum** is:
    - If 
        - a task $T$ is divided into tasks $T_1, T_2, ...T_n$,
        - The divided tasks $T1$ can be done in $p$ ways, $T2$ can be done in $q$ ways, $T3$ can be done in $r$ ways and so on,
        - $T1, T2, T3..$. are **NOT happening simultaneously**, i.e. mutually exclusive tasks.
    - Then,
        - The total number of ways to do the task $T$ is $p + q + r + ...$
