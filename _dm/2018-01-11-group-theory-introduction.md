- Group theory is **study of groups**.
	- Group are collection of elements, 
	- but unlike sets groups can have different types of elements, i.e. **it can contain elements of different catagories**.
- Before going further, we should have basic understanding of **Algebric Structures**.

## Algebric Structures

- An algebric structure **consists of** 
	- A **non empty set**,
	- **Collection of operations**, and
	- **Finite set of identities**
- When we perform those operations on any of the element in that structure output should be in that structure, i.e. satisfies **closure** property for those operations.
	- $ S,$
	- $ a \times b = c $
	- $ if \,\, \forall (a, b \in S), \,\, then \,\, c \in S $
- Some examples of structures:
	- **Groups-like**
		- Structure with **one** binary operaion.
		- These are what we study in group theory.
	- **Ring-like**
		- Structure with **two** binary operations.
	- **Lattice-like**
		- **Two or more** binary operations.
- One **example** of algebric structure would be, 
	- Set of natural numbers under addition operation.
	- We can take two natural numbers, perform addition, we will get natural number.
