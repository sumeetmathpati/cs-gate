## Group-like structure properties

For structure $S$ with operation $\times$,

- **Closure Property** (as it's a algebric structure).
- **Associative Property**
	- $\forall a, b, c \in S,$
		- $a \times (a \times c) = (a \times b) \times c \in S$
- **Identity Element Property**
	- For **all element** $a$ in $S$, there exists an **unique** (only one) element $e$, when we do $a \times b$ we will get $a$ as output.
	- $\forall a \in S \ \exists \in S \| a \times e = a$

		- **Note:** Keep in mind that, there would be only one identity element for all the elements in structure.

- **Inverse Element Property**
	- For **all element**$a$in$S$, there exists an **unique** (one for each element) element$a'$, when we do$a \times b$we will get$e$(identity element of that set) as output.$
	- $\forall a \in S \exists a' \in S \| a \times a' = e$

		- **Note:** Keep in mind that, each element has it's saperate inverse element and that inverse element should be unique for each element.

- **Communative Property**
	-$\forall a, b, c \in S,$
		-$a \times b = b \times a$

## Group-like structure Types

### 1. Algebric Structure

- A structure is algebric structure if it satisfies only following properties:
	- Closure property

### 2. Semi-group

- A structure is semi-group if it satisfies only following properties:
	- Closure property
	- Associative property

### 3. Monoid

- A structure is monoid if it satisfies only following properties:
	- Closure property
	- Associative property
	- Identity element property

### 4. Group

- A structure is group if it satisfies only following properties:
	- Closure property
	- Associative property
	- Identity element property
	- Inverse property

### 4. Abelian Group

- A structure is group if it satisfies following properties:
	- Closure property
	- Associative property
	- Identity element property
	- Inverse property
	- Commutative property

## Examples

### 1st Example

Let$S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$be the structure with operation$\times_5$(mutliplication modulo), what's the type of this group-like structure?

**Solution**

- Satisfies closure property.
- Satisfies associative property.
- Satisfies identity property. 
	- With identity element 1.
- Doesn't satisfy inverse property.
	- 1' = 1 (because (1$\times_5$1 = 1))
	- 2' = 3 (because (2$\times_5$3 = 1))
	- 3' = 2 (because (3$\times_5$2 = 1))
	- 4' = 4 (because (4$\times_5$4 = 1))
	- 0' doens't have inverse element.

Hence we can say that, **the structure is not group but only monoid.**


### 2nd Example

Let$S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$be the structure with operation$+_5$(addition modulo), what's the type of this group-like structure?

**Solution**

- Satisfies closure property.
- Satisfies associative property.
- Satisfies identity property. 
	- With identity element element 1.
- Satisfies inverse property.
	- 0' = 0 (because (0$+_5$0 = 0))
	- 1' = 4 (because (1$+_5$4 = 0))
	- 2' = 3 (because (2$+_5$3 = 0))
	- 3' = 2 (because (3$+_5$2 = 0))
	- 4' = 1 (because (4$+_5$1 = 0))
- Satisfies commutative property.

Hence we can say that, **the structure is abelian group.**
