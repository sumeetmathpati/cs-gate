- The relation we are going to study here is an abstraction of relations we see in our everyday life such as those between **parent and child, between car and owner, AADHAR number and address etc.**
- **Relation are a structure on a set that pairs any two objects that satosfy the certain properties.**

# Cartesian Product

- **Cartesian product is a binary relation which forms a set of all the ordered pairs from one set to another.**
- Cartesian product is a **maximum relation set possible in two sets.**
- Relations are subsets of cartesian products.

# Number of Possible Relations

- The possible number of relations on two A ans B is 
- **2^(mn)**
    - m = |A|
    - n = |N|
- How?
    - There are m*n elements in cartesian product.
    - Each element in cartesian product has two option to be or not to be in a set to form different relations.
