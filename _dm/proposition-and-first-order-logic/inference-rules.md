- In an *argument* we have a **hypothesis or premises** which is assumed to be true and a **conclusion**.
    - Premises and conclusion both are propositions.
- Conclusion is derived using inference rules.
- The argument is true iff the conclusion is true (assuming all the premices are true).
- **Example,**
    - **Premises:** $p$
    - **Conclusion:** $p \lor q$
    - From premises we can say that the conslusion will always be true.
    - Hence we can say that the above argument is true.
- We can write the premises $p$ and conclusion $c$ as $\frac{p}{c}$

# Inference Rule and Implications

- The inference rules are tautologies in implications i.e. if the argument is true; the implication of **premises --> conslusion** will always be **tautology.**
- Example, $p \to (p \lor q)$ is tautology.

# Inference Rules

Given below are the commonly used inference rules.
