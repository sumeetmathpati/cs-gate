- It's also called as propositional calculus, zeroth-order-logic, statemet logic, sentintial calculus etc.
- It's a branch og [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic).
- In logic, Proposition are declarative sentence/statements which can have only two values: **true** or **false**.
    - I.e. propositional statements hold truth value, which can be wither true or false.
- Examples,
    - Statement: *"Sun rises at night"*
        - The truth value of above statement is **false**.
    - Statement: *"5> 3"*
        - The truth value of above statement is **true**.

# Compound Statements

- Propositional logics can be combined and breaked.
- Some statements are atomic and we can't break them further.
- Example
    - Statement: *"5 >= 3"*
        - The above statement can be broken into: *"5 > 3 or 5 = 3"*.
    - Statement: *"5 > 3"*
        - The above statement can't be broken further.
- In logic the two propositional statements can be connected with connectives.
