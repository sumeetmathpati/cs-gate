# Propositional Variable

- Propositional variable is used to store a proposition. 
    - Similar to the variables in algebra used to store real values.

# Well Formed Formula

- If P is proposition; then P is well formed formula.
- If a is WFF, then $\neg a$ is also a WFF.
- If P and Q are WFF, then $(P \land Q), (P \lor Q) , (P \to Q), (P \leftrightarrow Q)$ are also WFF.
