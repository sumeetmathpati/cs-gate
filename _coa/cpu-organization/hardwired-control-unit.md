- Hardwired control unit isimplemented using hardwares such as decoders, multiplexers, logic gates, etc.
- As hardwared as used, this organization is **very fast.**
- But due to the hardware implementation, **design is complext** and the **updation in the control logic is difficult.**
	- Hence used in simple control circuits.
