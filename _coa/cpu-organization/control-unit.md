- We've seen that CPU uses many devices to perform operations. To perform one simple operations CPU may require more than one devices. 
To activate the devices CPU requires now (from all the available devices) CPU sends control signal respective to that device and operation.
	- For example RAM and registers can receive *Read* or *Write* control signals.
- CPU has *control unit* which generated these control signals.

# Control Variable

- It's a **name of the signal.**
- Suppose we have following control signals:

|R1|R2|IR|MAR|MBR|AC|PC|ALU|RAM|
|IO<br>xx|IO<br>xx|IO<br>xx|IO<br>xx|IO<br>xx|IO<br>xx|IO<br>xx|Opcode<br>xxxx|RW<br>xx|

See the previous lesson to understand how these signals work.

# Control Word

- Control word is a collection of all the signals generated by *control unit.*
- There is a different control word for different micro-operation.

- **MAR <-- PC**
	- Hence, if we send control signal `000000100001xxxx00` from control unit, then the data path for micro-operation `MAR <-- PC` will be enables and the data from *PC* will be copied into *MAR*.
- **MBR <â€“ M[MAR]**
- **IR <-- MDR, PC <-- PC + 1**
- Hence, we can say that control unit somehow has to generate specific sequece control signals (control worlds) for specific micro-operations.

|Micro-operation|Control Word|
|-|-|
|MO 1|010...0|
|MO 2|000...1|
|MO 3|110...0|
|.<br>.<br>.|.<br>.<br>.|
|MO n|110...1|


# Control Unit Organization.

- We know that control unit generates the specific control word for specific micro-operation as per CPUs requirement. But how contorl unit generated the signals? Here we are going to see that.
- These control organizations are created by manufacturer based on specific architecture of CPU.
- We have two basic types of control unit organizations
	- **Hardwired Control Unit**
	- **Microprogrammed Control Unit**
