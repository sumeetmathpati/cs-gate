- Algorithm is step by step solution for arithmetic problems.
- **Why we analyze the algorithm?**
    - If there are more than one algorithms to solve the same problems, we need to analyze and compare them to find out which algorithm is better.
- We analyze the algorithm on the basic of
    - **Space complexity**
        - Space needed to run the algorithm.
        - We dont count the size of input data.
    - **Time complexity**
        - Time needed to run the algorithm.
    
# Rate of Growth?

- **The rate at which the running time increases as a input increases is called rate of growth.**

# Complexity Notations

- Constant = $1$
- Logarithmic = $log \, n$
- Linear = $n$
- log linear = $n*log \, n$
- Quadratic = $n^2$
- Cubic = $n^3$
- Exponential = $n^n$
