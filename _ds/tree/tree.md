- Tree is a **non linear data structure.**
- It's a collection of nodes and edges with.
- In tree, single root node is present and rest of the nodes are divided into disjoint subsets where each set is a tree.

# Terminologies

- **Path :** 
    - Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.
- **Root :** 
    - The first node at the top of the tree is called root node. There is only one root per tree.
- **Parent :** 
    - Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.
- **Child :** 
    - The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node
- **Leaf :** 
    - The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.
- **Height / Depth:** 
    - Height of a tree starts from 0. 
    - Height of a root node is 0.
    - Height of the tree is maximim path from root to leaf node.
- **Levels :** 
    - Level of tree starts from 1. 
    - Root node is at level 1.
    - Level if height + 1.
